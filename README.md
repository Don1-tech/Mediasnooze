Hi there üñê
I am developing a software application that controls the amount of time one spends on the internet to improve mental health and overall wellbeing. Spending excessive time on social media can lead to poor time management skills. By helping users track and control their online activities, the software can assist in prioritizing tasks and allocating time effectively, resulting in better time management and a more balanced life.
Social media platforms are designed to be highly engaging and addictive, often leading to fragmented attention and reduced ability to concentrate. By limiting online distractions, the software can promote better focus and concentration, enabling users to engage more deeply in tasks that require sustained attention.The software provides insights and analytics about users' online behavior, such as time spent on different platforms or specific apps. This information can help users become more aware of their online habits and make informed decisions about their digital usage, promoting digital literacy and responsible online behavior.
